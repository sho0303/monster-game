# Small Village Background - Proportion Fix

## 🎯 Problem Solved
**Issue**: The wooden village had buildings that were too tall (8-11 pixels high) and looked like wooden skyscrapers rather than cozy cottages.

**Solution**: Redesigned with just 2 properly proportioned small houses that create an authentic fantasy village atmosphere.

- **Appearance**: Wooden high-rises/skyscrapers
- **Feel**: Overwhelming and unrealistic

### After (Perfect Scale):
- **2 Houses** with proper spacing
- **Heights**: 4, 5 pixels (cottage scale)
- **Roof Height**: 3 pixels 
- **Appearance**: Cozy village cottages
- **Feel**: Welcoming and authentic
