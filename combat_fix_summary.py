print("🐛 THE PROBLEM:")
print("   Monsters were only 'countering' the hero, never attacking first!")
print("   This was due to timing issues with asynchronous combat animations.")
print()

print("❌ What Was Broken:")
print("   • Hero animation used 1500ms delay with .after()")
print("   • Monster 'counter-attack' happened immediately") 
print("   • No delay between hero damage and monster response")
print("   • Combat loop couldn't handle async timing properly")
print("   • Monster attacks were labeled as 'counters' even when first")
print()

print("✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:")
print()
print("1. 🎯 Proper Attack Terminology:")
print("   • Monster attacks first: 'Cyclops attacks first for 8 damage!'")
print("   • Monster counters: 'Cyclops counters for 8 damage!'")
print("   • Hero attacks first: 'You strike first! You hit for 12 damage!'")
print("   • Hero counters: 'You counter-attack for 12 damage!'")
print()

print("2. ⏰ Async Combat Flow:")
print("   • Converted combat loop to event-driven system")
print("   • _start_combat_round() handles round initiation")
print("   • _complete_hero_attack_with_counter() manages hero→monster sequence")
print("   • _complete_hero_attack_finish_round() handles monster→hero sequence")
print("   • _monster_counter_attack() provides proper counter timing")
print()

print("3. 🎮 Combat Round Structure:")
print("   Hero Goes First:")
print("   ├─ Hero animation (1.5s)")
print("   ├─ Hero damage text + sound")
print("   ├─ 800ms pause")
print("   ├─ Monster counter-attack")
print("   ├─ Round status display") 
print("   └─ Next round after 1.5s")
print()
print("   Monster Goes First:")
print("   ├─ Monster attack immediately")
print("   ├─ 800ms pause") 
print("   ├─ Hero animation (1.5s)")
print("   ├─ Hero counter damage + sound")
print("   ├─ Round status display")
print("   └─ Next round after 1.5s")
print()

print("4. 🔄 Proper Combat Continuation:")
print("   • Each round properly transitions to the next")
print("   • Combat ends when HP reaches 0")
print("   • 1 second delay before showing win/loss screen")
print("   • No more race conditions or timing conflicts")
print()

print("🎯 COMBAT EXAMPLES:")
print()
print("Example 1 - Monster Attacks First:")
print("   Round 1: Cyclops attacks first for 8 damage!")
print("   Round 1: You counter-attack for 12 damage!")
print("   Round 2: You strike first! You hit for 15 damage!")
print("   Round 2: Cyclops counters for 6 damage!")
print()

print("Example 2 - Hero Attacks First:")  
print("   Round 1: You strike first! You hit for 14 damage!")
print("   Round 1: Vampire counters for 9 damage!")
print("   Round 2: Vampire attacks first for 11 damage!")
print("   Round 2: You counter-attack for 13 damage!")
print()

print("🚀 RESULT:")
print("   ✅ Monsters now properly ATTACK first (50% chance)")
print("   ✅ Monsters properly COUNTER when hero attacks first")
print("   ✅ Perfect animation timing with proper delays")
print("   ✅ Clean combat flow with no race conditions")
print("   ✅ Proper terminology for all combat actions")
